- Dedicated nature/hiking days (Bohemian Switzerland)
- More flexibility and rest days
- Better city variety (5 countries vs 4)
- Party-focused trip with balance
- Detailed activity planning

### Choose ITER2 if you want:

- Budget optimization (₹1.6-1.8L achievable)
- Picturesque mountain driving (St. Johann, Kitzbühel route)
- More Austria exposure
- Lake-focused experience (Mondsee, Gosausee)
- Imperial/Habsburg history (Vienna to Budapest corridor)

---

## Hybrid Recommendation

**Best of Both Worlds:**
1. Use Current Itinerary as base (better structure)
2. Add Innsbruck (2 nights) by cutting Dresden day trip
3. Include Gosausee stop on way to Hallstatt
4. Keep Bohemian Switzerland (irreplaceable)
5. Adopt Iter2's budget tips (stay in border towns, cook some meals)

**Modified Route:**
```
Prague (3 nights) → Bohemian Switzerland → Český Krumlov (1 night) →
Salzburg/Freilassing (1 night) → Innsbruck area (2 nights) →
Gosausee → Hallstatt → Vienna (2 nights) → Bratislava → Budapest (3 nights) →
Prague (1 night) → Departure
```

This gives you:
- Alpine experience of Iter2
- Nightlife of Current Itinerary
- Nature days intact
- Budget savings from border town stays
- Best scenic routes from both

---

## Final Verdict

**Current Itinerary wins 65-50** for a group of young travelers (25-27) seeking a balanced trip of nature, culture, AND nightlife.

However, if your priorities lean heavily toward:
- **Pure scenery/photography** → Go with Iter2
